This is a simple Python tool to help you analyze folks on Twitter.

Enter one or more Twitter handles.

State whether you want to analyze their followers/people they follow.

Enter some keywords to filter people on (based on description).

Grab a latte and sit back for your output (JSON and CSV) to be created.

To use you'll need to create your own Twitter application tokens.
